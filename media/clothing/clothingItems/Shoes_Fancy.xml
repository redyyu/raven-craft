	<!-- I guess this is sort of hacking, shoes not really cover the mask 11, 
		 but use this to trigger underlaymask to work.
		 to do this, MUST ovrride BodyLoaction.lua, put `Shoes` before `Jacket` or `Skirt` something.
		 otherwise will brake the mash when waring Jacket with Skirt. 
		 (see what happend by image somewhere in this project, proprobably in _assets folder)
		 BUT, this is not good idea to ovrride this way.
		 other mod might do samething, than cause conflict.
		 WHY do this? because for the hightheels with foot instep showing up.
		 MUST trigger the underlayMaks to work, might need use one of mask.
		 CAN NOT use mask 8 and 10, that will masking both feet.
		 But If no mask, the highheel wont showing up.
		 only mask 11 will not mask any body part, but it will effect other clothes with model.
		 etc. `Jacket` or `Skirt`... that why need put `Shoes` before others in BodyLocation.
		 that's hacking way, might cause other problem don't know yet.

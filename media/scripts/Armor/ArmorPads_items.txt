		Added blood clothing type to every possible body location, so you can easily mod a new clothing to protect X or Y parts:
		Example, i want to do metal socks that protect both feet and lower legs, i'll simply add a BloodLocation = Feet;LowerLegs, in the item script.
		Full list of per-bodypart location:

		Bag (back), Hands, Head, Neck, UpperBody, LowerBody, LowerLegs, UpperLegs, LowerArms, UpperArms, Groin.

		Each location will cover both left and right parts if needed.

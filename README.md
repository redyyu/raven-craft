# For Develpers 


## ClothingItem Tips

`<m_MaleModel>`, `<m_FemaleModel>` path to 3D model file, X or fbx, X is too old, so use fbx.
DO NOT just convert X to fbx, if skinned info will be lost, model will not working anymore.

`<m_GUID>` the guid for thi item, must add to fileGuidTable.xml from `media` folder,
otherwise item will not found. Use same GUID to ovrride the others.

`<m_AllowRandomHue>true</m_AllowRandomHue>` change the color of texture base on Hue.
`<m_AllowRandomTint>true</m_AllowRandomTint>` tint the texture, so light texuture will be nice. 
dark texture also work, but most time tint to more darkness.

`<m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>`  attach bone info. I don't know how to use it yet.

`<m_Masks>11</m_Masks>` the number id of the body part will be masked. (0-15) any other numbers will crash the game.

`<m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>` mask folder, but I dont know how effect the results yet.

`<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>fancyshoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>` underlay mask folder, for closthes with model.

`<textureChoices>` the path to texture file, must be png, no need file ext. path startswith textures folder.

`<m_BaseTextures>` it is for body base, which mean is for none model closthes, I guess.
**<m_BaseTextures>clothes\gloves\leathergloves_brown</m_BaseTextures>**

*Example here*

```
<clothingItem>
    <m_MaleModel>media\models_X\Static\Clothes\fancyshoes_male.fbx</m_MaleModel>
    <m_FemaleModel>media\models_X\Static\Clothes\fancyshoes_female.fbx</m_FemaleModel>
    <m_GUID>b87c05cc-9a93-4572-99f8-005e350ee723</m_GUID>
    <m_Static>false</m_Static>
    <m_AllowRandomHue>true</m_AllowRandomHue>
    <m_AllowRandomTint>true</m_AllowRandomTint>
    <m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>
    <m_Masks>11</m_Masks>
    <m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>
    <m_UnderlayMasksFolder>media/textures/Clothes/Shoes/Masks/fancyshoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_white</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_brown</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_red</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_pale</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_pink</textureChoices>
</clothingItem>
```

*KEEP IN MIND*

`<m_Masks>` is taken orders. For example, if a `Shoes` item set `m_Makes` to 11, `Skirt` will be show strange buggey.
because `Skirt` have a port in 11, and `Skirt` rendering before `Shoes`,
`Shoes`'s Underlay Maskswill not only mask itself, but other underlays.


very important is the if Ovrride Vanilla ClothingItems, IT MUST place intro `fileGuidTable.xml`.
otherwise not fully work, might change texture or masks will change someting, but not really, the model still wrong.


I guess this is sort of hacking, shoes not really cover the mask 11, 
but use this to trigger underlaymask to work.
to do this, MUST ovrride BodyLoaction.lua, put `Shoes` before `Jacket` or `Skirt` something.
otherwise will brake the mash when waring Jacket with Skirt. 
(see what happend by image somewhere in this project, proprobably in _assets folder)
BUT, this is not good idea to ovrride this way.
other mod might do samething, than cause conflict.
WHY do this? because for the hightheels with foot instep showing up.
MUST trigger the underlayMaks to work, might need use one of mask.
CAN NOT use mask 8 and 10, that will masking both feet.
But If no mask, the highheel wont showing up.
only mask 11 will not mask any body part, but it will effect other clothes with model.
etc. `Jacket` or `Skirt`... that why need put `Shoes` before others in BodyLocation.
that's hacking way, might cause other problem don't know yet.

```
<m_Masks>11</m_Masks>
<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>media/textures/Clothes/Shoes/Masks/fancy_shoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>
```


`<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>` seems only work when `m_masks` setted.


## 3D Model with animation

### Models_X

Seems folders id dosn't really matter.
different folder for easy to separate different models.

**Skinned/**: for hair, clothing, include bags. models must have skinned info.
**Static/**: for gears or shoes.
**Weapons/**: for weapons.
**Worlditems/**: for Items when drop on the floor.
*others can custom folder*

Define models with *clothingItem*, only have to give right path to the model file.
both male or female, model file could be same. `/` or `\` seems dosn't matter. 
path starts from *media/models_x*. also no matter uppercase or not.
```
<clothingItem>
    <m_MaleModel>skinned\clothes\bob_hazmat</m_MaleModel>
    <m_FemaleModel>skinned\clothes\kate_hazmat</m_FemaleModel>
    <m_GUID>c8e9ccd6-1a04-4211-a604-4e82e627cc0f</m_GUID>
    <m_Static>false</m_Static>
    <m_AllowRandomHue>false</m_AllowRandomHue>
    <m_AllowRandomTint>false</m_AllowRandomTint>
    <m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>
    <m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>
    <textureChoices>clothes/ArmorPads/ElbowPads</textureChoices>
</clothingItem>
```

Define models by `<name>_models` in scripts.
`model <Name> {...}` for static model. name better to Capitalized.
`model <Name>_Ground {...}` for Worlditems model. name better to Capitalized.

in `<name>_items` scripts, `StaticModel = ` is for the item self, `WorldStaticModel = ` is for item when drop on floor (Worlditems),

there is no need write theme in separate script file, could be same one.

for the block of **model**:

`mesh =` is the path of model file, starts from *media/models_x*, better to use fbx. 
`texture` is path for texture, starts from *media/texutre*
*in mesh = <model_file_name_>|<object_name>, No need use `|` if export by selected Object from blender. this is use to separate multiple different object in same .fbx files*

*for example:*

```
model Canteen {
    mesh = Static/Gear/canteen,
    texture = Gear/canteen,
    attachment world
    {
        offset = 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000,
        rotate = 180.0000 0.0000 0.0000,
    }
}

item Canteen {
    Weight = 0.1,
    CanStoreWater =TRUE,
    Type = Normal,
    DisplayName = Canteen,
    ReplaceOnUseOn = WaterSource-Canteenfull,
    icon = Canteen,
    RainFactor = 1,
    Tooltip = Tooltip_item_RainFromGround,
    
    AttachmentType = Canteen,

    StaticModel = Canteen,
    WorldStaticModel = Canteen_Ground,
}
```

### anims_X and AnimSets

3D model files in place in **anims_X**, It could be DirectX (.X) file or fbx. 
no matter folder or file name, no file path need too.

the `anims_X` or `animSets` name is defined in the file. engine will loaded all files,
and put in some stack, use theme must by name defined in those files.

the .X file seems could use txt format, that mean you can edit by text editor, if you understand what are you doing.
no matter the .X file name, in the file have a attribute `AnimationSet <name>`, this name is used for `<m_AnimName>` in **AnimSets**

```
AnimationSet SOMETHINE_Idle {...}
```

for .fbx, seems the animationSet name is set by `Action Strip` name (the one one the timeline of `NLATracks`),
in `Nolinear Animation` Panel (which is switch by little button top left of current panel)
in the timeline of NLATracks, right click and rename it. 
if no NLATrack exsit, try select the animate action you want than click on the menu `Add -> Add Tracks`.

when export set the transform to `-Z forward / Y up` and armature primary bone `X aixs`, secondary bone `Y aixs`.
sometime the exported model is messup, try reverse the those options, might be problem may solved.

*better to learn more about blender anyway.*

the etc. `Dummy01|BenchIn`
*import a fbx anims_x file to blender, you will see the animation node.*
*Looks like zombiod engine will load all 3dModel in anims_x folder, whatever what is it. than place it in same stack, find it by animationSet name when use it.*

For `AnimSets` file, see a example of Fitness Exercises with Treadmill.

*file: Treadmill.xml*
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animNode>
    <m_Name>treadmill</m_Name>
    <m_AnimName>Exercises_Run</m_AnimName>

        <boneName>Translation_Data</boneName>
    </m_SubStateBoneWeights>
</animNode>
```

`<m_Name>treadmill</m_Name>`: is the animation set name, it is trigger by `<m_Conditions>`, see this:
```
<m_Conditions>
    <m_Name>ExerciseType</m_Name>
    <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
    <m_StringValue>treadmill</m_StringValue>
</m_Conditions>
```
*When set player's ExerciseType == 'treadmill' (in lua or java), this animation will be trigger.*
*<m_Name> will also use to <m_Transitions>, explain later.*

`<m_AnimName>Exercises_Run</m_AnimName>`: the anims_X name used for this animation,
remember is not file name, is the `AnimationSet <name>` for .X file. is `Action Strip` name for .fbx.


*file: TreadmillOut.xml, play when leave the treadmill*
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animNode x_extends="Treadmill.xml">

`<m_Name>treadmillout</m_Name>`: the name here is animation set name too,
this animation is trigger by `<m_Conditions>` too, see this:

```

    <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
    <m_BoolValue>true</m_BoolValue>

```

*When ExerciseEnded (toggle by lua or java somewhere), this animation will play.*

**but why there not ExerciseType, how come to know that's end of treadmill? see this:**
`<animNode x_extends="Treadmill.xml">` that mean is this xml is extands from `Treadmill.xml`, the ExerciseType is defined there.

the animation goes to `Treadmill.xml` first, then conditions change and match with the on in TreadmillOut.xml.
that's how animation works, I guess.


folders in the **AnimSets**, is really matter. those folder is defined by game as default.
It is separate folders for different character events. seems you won't easy to create new one.
those events is trigger by many other ways, such as player state and conditions. etc. `climbSheetRope`.

for equipable items, might set by `ReplaceInPrimaryHand = <clothingItem> <animtionset name>, `
like this
```
ReplaceInPrimaryHand = none holdingbikeright, /* no clothingItem need, just give nothing. */
```

`holdingbikeright` is anim set name.
the clotingItem is replace by none here, because there is no need clothingItem.

if need, just give a clothingItem name, and set model and texture in the clothingItem file.
just like all the bags from vanilla.


**No need to restart the game, when animSets is chagned, the game will reload it (few seconds later). but better restart game when delete or add xml (or x_extends= is changed) for animSets, incace strange happen.**

when game want animation will go to folders in **AnimSets** to find one matched.
**Different type animation will go different folder first**
after that, will find first one match all conditions will be play.

*like this: in idle folder*
```
<animNode>
    <m_Name>idle_Swim</m_Name>
    <m_AnimName>SwimIdle</m_AnimName>
    <m_Conditions>
        <m_Name>isSwimming</m_Name>
        <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
        <m_BoolValue>true</m_BoolValue>
    </m_Conditions>
    <m_Conditions>
        <m_Name>isMoving</m_Name>
        <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
        <m_BoolValue>false</m_BoolValue>
    </m_Conditions>
</animNode>
```
first player character must be idle, that mean go idle folder find one animation.
condition must be `isMoving=false` and `isSwimming=true`.

```
<animNode>
    <m_Name>idle_Swim</m_Name>
    <m_AnimName>SwimIdle</m_AnimName>
    <m_Conditions>
        <m_Name>isSwimming</m_Name>
        <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
        <m_BoolValue>true</m_BoolValue>
    </m_Conditions>
</animNode>
```

if not condition of `isMoving`, seems play as well.
because it is idle state, character is not moving anyway.
but if the animation might have little bit gap.
Also if no Condition `isSwimming` will conflict with default `Idle`.
may not play or cause other problems.

*becareful with state.*


#### Transitions (guess)

Defined how to transition between current animation to target animation.
its no effect which animation should be play with state.
only the transition.

which state animation to go is driver by game engine.

```
<m_Transitions>
    <m_Target>defaultRun</m_Target>
    <m_AnimName>Bob_Run</m_AnimName>
    <m_blendInTime>0.3</m_blendInTime>
    <m_blendOutTime>0.3</m_blendOutTime>
</m_Transitions>
```

`<m_Target>` is the anim set name, not file name.
`<m_AnimName>` the animtion playing while transition. no animation play if not give this option.
`<m_blendInTime>` and `<m_blendOutTime>` is the time of transition animation.




## Strange Errors


### Recipe Format is wrong

if got `ISCraftingUI` exceptions, probably is Recipe Script is wrong, might missing `,` end of some line.

### No math.round()

use math.floor(n + 0.5) to make round().
lua sucks.



### MOD Sandbox options wrong cause Game Crash when Boot

Only got Unhandled Exception, that usual mean is MOD is block starting.

```

```

at last checkout the sandbox options. default is large than max. that's problmen cause crash.
```
option RavenCraft.SurvivalJournalMultiplierModifier{
    type = integer, min = 1, max = 12, default = 20,
}
```



## Generator UI window buggey

*This problem is not related with this mod.*
windows in Vanilla game might buggey, like generator info window.
go `zomboid` folder which contain `save` folder,
in `zomboid/lua/layout.ini` could fix that. just change the size.
```
ISSearchWindow x=120 y=300 visible=false pin=true width=300 height=180

## AddItem with Count in script

In Vanilla, recipe with Cigarettes = 20, will cause result x20 (800),
but Cigarettes=1 will only get 1. thats because item `Cigarettes` is count 20,
when use AddItems /AddItem with String type name will effect by the count. I guess.
```
   (in DOCS https://pzwiki.net/wiki/Scripts_guide/Item_Script_Parameters/Count)
   Count:
   Determines how many items of this type will appear when spawning/crafting this type of item.
```
try DO NOT override the item script `Count`, otherwise will effect numbers when distribution.

```
function Recipe.OnCreate.OpenCigarettesPack(items, result, player)
   if result:getFullType() == "Base.Cigarettes" then
        for i=0, items:size() -1 do
            local item = items:get(i)
            if item:getType() == 'CigarettesPack' then
                -- In Recipoe `Result: Cigarettes,`
                -- result have only 1 Cigarettes

                -- AddItem or AddItems with String name will trigger the `Count`
                -- player:getInventory():AddItem("Base.Cigarettes")
                -- -- addItem for Cigarettes, now will be 21,
                -- player:getInventory():RemoveOneOf("Base.Cigarettes")
                -- -- remove one of it, now will be 20.

                local count = math.floor(item:getUsedDelta() / item:getUseDelta() + 0.5)
                for j=1, count - 1 do -- remember recipe will create one.
                    local cigarettes = InventoryItemFactory.CreateItem("Base.Cigarettes")
                    -- AddItem with InventoryItem will be fine.  AddItems will not
                    player:getInventory():AddItem(cigarettes)
                end
            end
        end
   end
end
```


## Modelling with Blender

export `.fbx` file for now. `X` is too old.
if make **Static** model, like shoes / mask/ hat, can bind bone in **ClothingItem** or make to skinned bind in model both work.
if make skinned model might use the template with bone from `_assets/`.

when export Staic model to `.fbx`, should take care of the **Transform** settings *Up* and *Forward*.
Can also just move or rotate the model to right position in model, and leave the default settings and export.
try not select **Armature** and **Bake Animation**. not sure what happen, maybe nothing.

*Becareful the size of model*. most time the model in game is really small, must set scale to very small in export settings. etc. `0.01`
but could be any size when modeling, bigger enough too operate.



## TimedAction


### isValidStart only trigger when after another action completed.

`perform` must before the `eatItem`, because in `ISEatFoodAction` have `isValidStart()`
it will check MoodleLevel of Eaten, when character is too full, will stop the queue,
but `isValidStart()` only trigger when a queue action onComplete, it's not trigger by first action.

** in `ISEatFoodAction` **
```
function ISEatFoodAction:isValidStart()
    return self.character:getMoodles():getMoodleLevel(MoodleType.FoodEaten) < 3 or self.character:getNutrition():getCalories() < 1000
end
```
** in `ISTimedActionQueue` **
```
function ISTimedActionQueue:onCompleted(action)
    self:removeFromQueue(action)

    self.current = self.queue[1]

    if self.current then
        if self.current:isValidStart() then
            self.current:begin()
        else
            print('bugged action, cleared queue ', self.current.Type or "???")
            self:resetQueue()
            return
        end
    end
end
```


# Timed Actions

if character wear item instantly, check the cheat menu, `Timed Action instant` might be turned ON.

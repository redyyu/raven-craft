## Training

Add simple training simulation in Craft System for `First Aid`, `Tailoring` and `Mechanic`.
Those skill perk are diffcult to level up, Player always need sort of *Auto Script* to avoid repeat clicking.
So... why not create a simple traning progress.

Those traning require matched skill and some materials (most stuff are not consume after tranning). 
Aslo all traning can level up to Lv6, after Lv6 will lower the XP gain. very very low...

Add training for melee weapon perks level up to 3. Such as `Axe`, `Small Blade`, `Long Blade`, `Small Blunt`, `Blunt`, `Spear`.

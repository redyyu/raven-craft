# Raven Craft

A Project zomboid mod. expanding vanilla constructable facilities and craftable items.

# For Develpers 


## ClothingItem Tips

`<m_MaleModel>`, `<m_FemaleModel>` path to 3D model file, X or fbx, X is too old, so use fbx.
DO NOT just convert X to fbx, if skinned info will be lost, model will not working anymore.

`<m_GUID>` the guid for thi item, must add to fileGuidTable.xml from `media` folder,
otherwise item will not found. Use same GUID to ovrride the others.

`<m_AllowRandomHue>true</m_AllowRandomHue>` change the color of texture base on Hue.
`<m_AllowRandomTint>true</m_AllowRandomTint>` tint the texture, so light texuture will be nice. 
dark texture also work, but most time tint to more darkness.

`<m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>`  attach bone info. I don't know how to use it yet.

`<m_Masks>11</m_Masks>` the number id of the body part will be masked. (0-15) any other numbers will crash the game.

`<m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>` mask folder, but I dont know how effect the results yet.

`<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>fancyshoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>` underlay mask folder, for closthes with model.

`<textureChoices>` the path to texture file, must be png, no need file ext. path startswith textures folder.

`<m_BaseTextures>` it is for body base, which mean is for none model closthes, I guess.
**<m_BaseTextures>clothes\gloves\leathergloves_brown</m_BaseTextures>**

*Example here*

```
<clothingItem>
    <m_MaleModel>media\models_X\Static\Clothes\fancyshoes_male.fbx</m_MaleModel>
    <m_FemaleModel>media\models_X\Static\Clothes\fancyshoes_female.fbx</m_FemaleModel>
    <m_GUID>b87c05cc-9a93-4572-99f8-005e350ee723</m_GUID>
    <m_Static>false</m_Static>
    <m_AllowRandomHue>true</m_AllowRandomHue>
    <m_AllowRandomTint>true</m_AllowRandomTint>
    <m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>
    <m_Masks>11</m_Masks>
    <m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>
    <m_UnderlayMasksFolder>media/textures/Clothes/Shoes/Masks/fancyshoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_white</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_brown</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_red</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_pale</textureChoices>
    <textureChoices>clothes/Shoes/shoes_pink</textureChoices>
</clothingItem>
```

*KEEP IN MIND*

`<m_Masks>` is taken orders. For example, if a `Shoes` item set `m_Makes` to 11, `Skirt` will be show strange buggey.
because `Skirt` have a port in 11, and `Skirt` rendering before `Shoes`,
`Shoes`'s Underlay Maskswill not only mask itself, but other underlays.


very important is the if Ovrride Vanilla ClothingItems, IT MUST place intro `fileGuidTable.xml`.
otherwise not fully work, might change texture or masks will change someting, but not really, the model still wrong.


I guess this is sort of hacking, shoes not really cover the mask 11, 
but use this to trigger underlaymask to work.
to do this, MUST ovrride BodyLoaction.lua, put `Shoes` before `Jacket` or `Skirt` something.
otherwise will brake the mash when waring Jacket with Skirt. 
(see what happend by image somewhere in this project, proprobably in _assets folder)
BUT, this is not good idea to ovrride this way.
other mod might do samething, than cause conflict.
WHY do this? because for the hightheels with foot instep showing up.
MUST trigger the underlayMaks to work, might need use one of mask.
CAN NOT use mask 8 and 10, that will masking both feet.
But If no mask, the highheel wont showing up.
only mask 11 will not mask any body part, but it will effect other clothes with model.
etc. `Jacket` or `Skirt`... that why need put `Shoes` before others in BodyLocation.
that's hacking way, might cause other problem don't know yet.

```
<m_Masks>11</m_Masks>
<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>media/textures/Clothes/Shoes/Masks/fancy_shoes</m_UnderlayMasksFolder>
```


`<m_UnderlayMasksFolder>` seems only work when `m_masks` setted.


## 3D Model with animation

### Models_X

Seems folders id dosn't really matter.
different folder for easy to separate different models.

**Skinned/**: for hair, clothing, include bags. models must have skinned info.
**Static/**: for gears or shoes.
**Weapons/**: for weapons.
**Worlditems/**: for Items when drop on the floor.
*others can custom folder*

Define models with *clothingItem*, only have to give right path to the model file.
both male or female, model file could be same. `/` or `\` seems dosn't matter. 
path starts from *media/models_x*. also no matter uppercase or not.
```
<clothingItem>
    <m_MaleModel>skinned\clothes\bob_hazmat</m_MaleModel>
    <m_FemaleModel>skinned\clothes\kate_hazmat</m_FemaleModel>
    <m_GUID>c8e9ccd6-1a04-4211-a604-4e82e627cc0f</m_GUID>
    <m_Static>false</m_Static>
    <m_AllowRandomHue>false</m_AllowRandomHue>
    <m_AllowRandomTint>false</m_AllowRandomTint>
    <m_AttachBone></m_AttachBone>
    <m_MasksFolder></m_MasksFolder>
    <textureChoices>clothes/ArmorPads/ElbowPads</textureChoices>
</clothingItem>
```

Define models by `<name>_models` in scripts.
`model <Name> {...}` for static model. name better to Capitalized.
`model <Name>_Ground {...}` for Worlditems model. name better to Capitalized.

in `<name>_items` scripts, `StaticModel = ` is for the item self, `WorldStaticModel = ` is for item when drop on floor (Worlditems),

there is no need write theme in separate script file, could be same one.

for the block of **model**:

`mesh =` is the path of model file, starts from *media/models_x*, better to use fbx. 
`texture` is path for texture, starts from *media/texutre*
*in mesh = <model_file_name_>|<object_name>, No need use `|` if export by selected Object from blender. this is use to separate multiple different object in same .fbx files*

*for example:*

```
model Canteen {
    mesh = Static/Gear/canteen,
    texture = Gear/canteen,
    attachment world
    {
        offset = 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000,
        rotate = 180.0000 0.0000 0.0000,
    }
}

item Canteen {
    Weight = 0.1,
    CanStoreWater =TRUE,
    Type = Normal,
    DisplayName = Canteen,
    ReplaceOnUseOn = WaterSource-Canteenfull,
    icon = Canteen,
    RainFactor = 1,
    Tooltip = Tooltip_item_RainFromGround,
    
    AttachmentType = Canteen,

    StaticModel = Canteen,
    WorldStaticModel = Canteen_Ground,
}
```

### anims_X and AnimSets

3D model files in place in **anims_X**, It could be DirectX (.X) file or fbx. 
no matter folder or file name, no file path need too.

the `anims_X` or `animSets` name is defined in the file. engine will loaded all files,
and put in some stack, use theme must by name defined in those files.

the .X file seems could use txt format, that mean you can edit by text editor, if you understand what are you doing.
no matter the .X file name, in the file have a attribute `AnimationSet <name>`, this name is used for `<m_AnimName>` in **AnimSets**

```
AnimationSet Trolley_Idle {...}
```

for .fbx, seems the animationSet name is set by Track's name, in `Nolinear Animation` Panel (which is switch by little button top left of current panel)
in the timeline of NLATracks, right click and rename it. if no NLATrack exsit, try select the animate action you want than click on the menu `Add -> Add Tracks`.

when export set the transform to `-Z forward / Y up` and armature primary bone `X aixs`, secondary bone `Y aixs`.
sometime the exported model is messup, try reverse the those options, might be problem may solved.

*better to learn more about blender anyway.*

the etc. `Dummy01|BenchIn`
*import a fbx anims_x file to blender, you will see the animation node.*
*Looks like zombiod engine will load all 3dModel in anims_x folder, whatever what is it. than place it in same stack, find it by animationSet name when use it.*

For `AnimSets` file, see a example of Fitness Exercises with Treadmill.

*file: Treadmill.xml*
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animNode>
    <m_Name>treadmill</m_Name>
    <m_AnimName>Exercises_Run</m_AnimName>
    <m_deferredBoneAxis>Z</m_deferredBoneAxis>
    <m_SyncTrackingEnabled>false</m_SyncTrackingEnabled>
    <m_SpeedScale>1.00</m_SpeedScale>
    <m_BlendTime>0.40</m_BlendTime>
    <m_Conditions>
        <m_Name>ExerciseType</m_Name>
        <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
        <m_StringValue>treadmill</m_StringValue>
    </m_Conditions>

    <m_SubStateBoneWeights>
        <boneName>Dummy01</boneName>
    </m_SubStateBoneWeights>
    <m_SubStateBoneWeights>
        <boneName>Translation_Data</boneName>
    </m_SubStateBoneWeights>
</animNode>
```

`<m_Name>treadmill</m_Name>`: is the animation set name, it is trigger by `<m_Conditions>`, see this:
```
<m_Conditions>
    <m_Name>ExerciseType</m_Name>
    <m_Type>STRING</m_Type>
    <m_StringValue>treadmill</m_StringValue>
</m_Conditions>
```
*When set player's ExerciseType == treadmill (in lua or java), this animation will be trigger.*


`<m_AnimName>Exercises_Run</m_AnimName>`: the anims_X name used for this animation,
remember is not file name, is the `AnimationSet <name>`.(name after ` | ` in animation node if fbx.)

*file: TreadmillOut.xml*
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<animNode x_extends="Treadmill.xml">
    <m_Name>treadmillout</m_Name>
    <m_AnimName>Exercises_Run</m_AnimName>
    <m_Looped>false</m_Looped>
    <m_Conditions />
    <m_Conditions>
        <m_Name>ExerciseEnded</m_Name>
        <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
        <m_BoolValue>true</m_BoolValue>
    </m_Conditions>
    <m_Events>
        <m_EventName>SetVariable</m_EventName>
        <m_Time>End</m_Time>
        <m_ParameterValue>FitnessFinished=TRUE</m_ParameterValue>
    </m_Events>
</animNode>
```

`<m_Name>treadmillout</m_Name>`: the name here is animation set name too,
this animation is trigger by `<m_Conditions>` too, see this:

```
<m_Conditions>
    <m_Name>ExerciseEnded</m_Name>
    <m_Type>BOOL</m_Type>
    <m_BoolValue>true</m_BoolValue>
</m_Conditions>
```

*When ExerciseEnded (toggle by lua or java somewhere), this animation will play.*

**but how know that's end of treadmill? see this:**
`<animNode x_extends="Treadmill.xml">` that mean is this xml is extands from `Treadmill.xml`, the ExerciseType is defined there.

the animation goes to `Treadmill.xml` first, then conditions change and match with the on in TreadmillOut.xml.
that's how animation works, I guess.


folders in the **AnimSets**, is really matter. those folder is defined by game as default.
It is separate folders for different character events. seems you won't easy to create new one.
those events is trigger by many other ways, such as player state and conditions. etc. `climbSheetRope`.

for items, might set by `ReplaceInPrimaryHand = <clothingItem> <animtionset name>, `
like this
```
ReplaceInPrimaryHand = none holdingtrolleyright, /* no clothingItem need, just give nothing. */
```

`holdingtrolleyright` is anim set name.
the clotingItem is replace by none here, because there is no need clothingItem.

if need, just give a clothingItem name, and set model and texture in the clothingItem file.
just like all the bags from vanilla.


**IMPORTANT: probably you need restart the game, when animSets is chagned.


## Strange Errors


### Recipe Format is wrong

if got `ISCraftingUI` exceptions, probably is Recipe Script is wrong, might missing `,` end of some line.

### No math.round()

use math.floor(n + 0.5) to make round().
lua sucks.



### MOD Sandbox options wrong cause Game Crash when Boot

Only got Unhandled Exception, that usual mean is MOD is block starting.

```

at last checkout the sandbox options. default is large than max. that's problmen cause crash.
```
option RavenCraft.SurvivalJournalMultiplierBase {
    type = integer, min = 1, max = 12, default = 20,
}
```
